#### - You're transitioning from a coder to a founder. What did you learn?

The most surprising thing I’ve learnt is that you have to do things
you don’t like doing. Things that should work only “good enough”.
Things that you are not good at. And even if you know how to do things
really well - you cannot do them, because you have other stuff to do.

To make your startup work - <b>you have to become a generalist and
learn how to cut corners.</b>
