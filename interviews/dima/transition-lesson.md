#### - You're transitioning from a coder to a founder. What did you learn?

It really hit me that I have to do things that I am not good at. Things like marketing or setting up servers didn't give me the fulfilment that was easily attainable with coding. But I did them anyways and found joy in the process.

And in times when I knew how to do something really well, I had to do them only "good enough". There are so many things to do and you are wasting your time if you try to be perfect everywhere.

To make your startup work - <b>you have to become a generalist and learn how to cut corners.</b>
