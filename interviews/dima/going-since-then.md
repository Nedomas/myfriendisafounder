#### - What we're your mistakes?

We tried to implement
<b>a "challenge" feature that required a complete in-app communication</b>.
We wasted too much time trying to make it work - it's not even used
now.

Then we <b>tried to compensate the fact that we only have Android app
by adding more features to Android app</b>. It was kind of
stupid to think it would work.
We ended up by making a responsive web that works on all devices.

We were getting feedback from our first users but
we guessed a lot of things wrong anyways.
