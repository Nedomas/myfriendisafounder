#### - What is your plan to turn it around?

We will be doing validation of product-market fit in offices that
we have agreed with before hand.  Once we have the initial validation,
weâ€™ll start raising angel capital to expand that validation both
in scale and in time.

By the way, we have a bigger vision. Once we have a critical mass
of users, we will roll out a feature where Playgong finds you a fellow
player of the similar skill near you for the sport you play. Most
importantly, skill level will be based on real data. Imagine, you
are bored and want to play tennis, you hit one button and you have
a fellow player of the similar skill that is fun to play with.
