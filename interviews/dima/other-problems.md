#### - What app would you pay for?

An <b>app that would give an indication on how healthy a product is</b>.
You can do it by scanning a barcode of a product in a grocery store.
Ideally it would list all the ingredients with health risks.
Reading the description on a package takes a lot of time.

I solve this by buying the stuff I know over and over again -
but it's sub-optimal.
