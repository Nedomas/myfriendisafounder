#### - Why did you <b>quit a well-paid coder job</b>?

I'm a coder just because I'm into making stuff that can be immediately
used. Starting a product company is just the next step.

I became interested in startups during studies and worked exclusively for
startups after graduation - B2B, then B2C. I care less about the sales, and much
more about great product and community. That is the reason I decided to build
a B2C startup myself.

The act of quitting a job is pretty simple. You save up money, get
support from your close ones and find ways to reduce your expenses.

<b>It gives your focus and dedication - you are setting yourself for
failure if you lack any of those.</b>
