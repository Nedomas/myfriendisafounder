#### - How do you motivate your co-founders?

Making a startup is such a demanding endeavour that I believe itâ€™s
nearly impossible to motivate someone to do it. Co-founders have
to be self-motivated for the most part. But of course everyone has
bad times, at such times it is very important that your co-founder
would keep moving forward. Nothing motivates more, than being one
step closer to your goal. Gladly, this is the case with Playgong team.
