#### - What helped you find you product market fit?

We were in the fog. Everything became much clearer after <b>writing
down user personas</b>. We could have saved a lot of time
if we did that before building anything.

I learn't the hard way that product management comes first.
You have <b>low chances by implementing everything that simply feels right</b>.

I believe that we have finally found our product-market fit. We
are really excited to test it in the upcoming weeks by <b>visiting offices
and having tournaments there</b>.

Weâ€™ll start raising angel capital once we have the initial validation.
