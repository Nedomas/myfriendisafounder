#### - How did you came up with Playgong?

We were playing table tennis in my last company. We decided to track
the results and create a leaderboard because we had real competition there.

<b>It started as a Google spreadsheet - dull and inconvenient.</b>

Then my colleague
<a href='https://twitter.com/viliusk' target='_blank'>Vilius</a>
came up with an idea of Playgong during the hackathon.
We made the prototype and won “Best app developed at App Camp 2013”
prize. Glorious days.

We started building the app in the evenings. Later I got fed
up with working like that and wanted to dedicate myself fully to
this. I quit my job and Vilius did that too.
